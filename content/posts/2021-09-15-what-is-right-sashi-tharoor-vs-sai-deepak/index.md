एकम सत विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति - the truth is one, wise express it in many ways

The discussion methodologies of Religions of Hinduism focus on ensure temperature of the body doesn't go up.
The classic example of this is Madana Mishra Vs Adi-Shankara. The person's whose flower garland retained its freshness the longest was the winner. As the primary interest was in discovery of the truth not just the facts.

The truth (Sathya) is constant which the wise man can see, but the facts can be manipulated.

### What is the truth?

Shashi Tharoor's wants reconciliation as he is legitimately worried about following the footsteps of the exclusionary Western Nationalism movements. He is also a passionate advocate for emotional repatriation for colonization of the Indians, made populuar in the Oxford debates.

J Sai Deepak is concerned about justice as Hindus in are the victims of colonization, and as a result comparing it with the European experience is invalid. He is articulating the pain point of the gaslighted community of Hindus which is yet to find legitimate expression and acceptance.

From the opening lines of Neuremberg trials:

> "The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating, that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot survive their being repeated."

Please watch the debate between ["Sashi Tharoor Vs J Sai Deepak"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB97_PCZ41w) without letting your body get heated.

Both Sashi Tharoor's and J Sai Deepak's views have to be adressed for Hinduism to survive and thrive. Ignoring of them Hindu Holocaust is an untold and unrecognized history.

3 steps that have to be taken
- Injustices done to Hindus have to be recorded and recognized to heal the wounds
- Acknowledge the wrong doing inorder to fix it
- Never let it repeat again
