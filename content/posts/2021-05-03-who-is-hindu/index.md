There is a popular misconception that the origin of the word Hindu is not from Hindus.
As with most popular opinions on Hinduism, it is just that - a misconception. It's a blindspot.

> हीनं दूषयति इति हिन्दू
>
> Hīnaṁ Dushyati Iti Hindu
>
>> One who renounced ignorance (delusion) and inferiority is called a Hindu.
>
>           - Shabd Kalpdrum

> हीनं च दूष्यत्येव हिन्दुरित्युच्चते प्रिये
>
> Hīnaṁ ca dūṣyatyēva hindurityuccatē priyē
>
>> O My dear! One who renounced ignorance (delusion) and inferiority is called Hindu
>>          - Meru Tantra (Shaiva Agama)

The definition of the word `Hindu` is an inclusive identity and grand narrative for all seekers across all Space and Time and not limited to geography.
