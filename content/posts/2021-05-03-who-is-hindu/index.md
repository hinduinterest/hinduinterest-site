There is a popular misconception amongs both Hindus and non-Hindus that origin of the world Hindu is not from Hindus.
As with most popular opinion on Hinduism it is just that - a misconception. Its a blindspot.

> हीनं दूषयति इति हिन्दू

> Hīnaṁ Dushyati Iti Hindu
>
>> One who renouced ignorance (delusion) and inferiority is called Hindu.

>           - Shabd Kalpdrum

> हीनं च दूष्यत्येव हिन्दुरित्युच्चते प्रिये
>
> Hīnaṁ ca dūṣyatyēva hindurityuccatē priyē
>
>> O My dear! One who renounced ignorance, delusion and inferiority is called Hindu
>>          - Meru Tantra (Shaiva Agama)

The definition of the word `Hindu` is itself an inclusive identity and grand narrative for all seekers across all Space and Time and not limited to a geography.
